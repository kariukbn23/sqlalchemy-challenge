# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

The following were the two phases of this project: 

Phase 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration

Phase 1 Description: To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Phase 2: Climate App 

Phase 2 Description: Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
